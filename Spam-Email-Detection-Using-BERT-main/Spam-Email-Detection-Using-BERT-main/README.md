# ðŸ“§ Spam Email Detection Using BERT (LLM-Based)

This project presents a **Large Language Model (LLM)-based solution** for detecting spam emails using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**. BERT, one of the foundational models in the transformer-based LLM era, is fine-tuned here for binary classification to distinguish between spam and legitimate (ham) emails.

---

## ðŸ§  Model Used

- **BERT-base-uncased** (from HuggingFace Transformers)
- Pre-trained transformer model, fine-tuned on spam/ham email data
- Supports contextual understanding of email content for highly accurate classification

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Spam Email Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashfakyeafi/spam-email-classification/data)
- Contains labeled emails categorized as `spam` or `ham`
- Cleaned and preprocessed for transformer tokenization

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Load & clean** the dataset
2. **Tokenize** email text using BERT tokenizer
3. **Fine-tune** BERT for binary classification using PyTorch
4. **Evaluate** using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation

*Include model performance here once trained:*

| Metric    | Score (%) |
|-----------|-----------|
| Accuracy  | TBD       |
| Precision | TBD       |
| Recall    | TBD       |
| F1-Score  | TBD       |
